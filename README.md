## Sample Email:

Subject: Urgent Action Required – Account Suspended

Dear User,
We have detected unusual activity on your Microsoft account. Please verify your identity by clicking the link below:

##  Phishing Traits Found:

|---------------------|-------------|
| Fake sender address | Uses `micros0ft` (with zero) to mimic Microsoft |
| Suspicious link     | URL is not a real Microsoft domain |
| Urgency             | “24 hours or suspended” creates panic |
